## Persisted trait and ids

All the entities returned from SORM have a [`Persisted`](/api/#sorm.Persisted) trait with an appropriate value of `id` mixed in. This is what lets SORM decide whether to `INSERT` rows or `UPDATE` them (and which ones) when the `save` operation is called. This also provides you with access to its generated `id`.

Since the `id` property value is meant to be generated by database, it is protected from the user of being able to manually specify it as well as letting the case classes have such a property.

So, instead of 
    
{% highlight scala %}
case class Artist ( id : Long, name : String ) 
{% endhighlight %}

you should use 

{% highlight scala %}
case class Artist ( name : String ) 
{% endhighlight %}

and let SORM take care of `id` property management for you.

### What should you do when you need to get an id of an entity?

Just do

{% highlight scala %}
artist.id 
{% endhighlight %}

but for you to be able to do that the `artist` value must have a `Persisted` trait mixed in (i.e., have a type `Artist with Persisted`), which can happen only in three cases:

1. When you store a value in the db: {% highlight scala %}
val artist = Db.save(Artist("Metallica")) 
{% endhighlight %}
    
2. When you fetch it from the db: {% highlight scala %}
val artist = Db.query[Artist].whereEqual("name", "Metallica").fetchOne().get
{% endhighlight %}

3. When you make a copy of an already persisted entity: {% highlight scala %}
val artist = someOtherPersistedArtist.copy(name = "METALLICA")
{% endhighlight %}


## Saving

Let's assume you have a following model registered with SORM `Instance`:

{% highlight scala %}
case class Genre ( name : String )
case class Artist ( name : String, genres : Set[Genre] )
{% endhighlight %}

### Storing a new entity

{% highlight scala %}
val metal : Genre with Persisted
  = Db.save(Genre("Metal"))
val metallica : Artist with Persisted
  = Db.save(Artist("Metallica", Set(metal))) 
{% endhighlight %}

Please note that executing `Db.save(Artist("Metallica", Set(Genre("Metal"))))` right away is prohibited, since the entities you want to persist may refer only to already persisted ones, and a freshly created `Genre("Metal")` as in this case is not yet persisted.

### Updating a persisted entity

{% highlight scala %}
val rock : Genre with Persisted
  = Db.save(Genre("Rock"))

val metallica : Option[Artist with Persisted]
  = Db.query[Artist]
      .whereEqual("name", "Metallica")
      .fetchOne()   //  fetch an entity from db
                    //  (returns `Option[Artist with Persisted]`)
      .map(a => a.copy(genres = a.genres + rock))
                    //  update the entity
      .map(Db.save) //  persist the updates to entity
{% endhighlight %}

Please note that the types are specified only for reference.
